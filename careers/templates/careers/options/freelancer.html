            <p>Freelancers are independent professionals who work for themselves, providing services to clients on a project-by-project basis.

            <p>Freelancing is a popular career choice due to its autonomy and the growing demand for specialized services in a variety of industries. Successful freelancers must possess a diverse skill set, including both technical abilities and business acumen.</p>
