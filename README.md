## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Career Dendrogram project locally:


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/01Prathamesh/Career_Dendrogram_Project.git
   cd Career_Dendrogram_Project

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Create a .env file:**
In the root of your project, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEWS_API_KEY="Your_News_API_Key"
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
   DJANGO_DEBUG=True
   DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS='127.0.0.1,localhost'
   DJANGO_DB_ENGINE='django.db.backends.sqlite3'
   DJANGO_DB_NAME='db.sqlite3'
   ```
- Replace 'your-secret-key' with a secret key for your Django application (you can generate one using Djangoâ€™s django.core.management.utils.get_random_secret_key() function).And 

5. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate

6. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

7. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


## Usage

## Technologies Used

This project uses a combination of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Backend**:
    - **Django**: A robust Python-based web framework to handle the backend logic and API.
    - **SQLite**: Default lightweight database used for development. You can configure a production database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
  
- **Frontend**:
    - **HTML5/CSS3**: For the basic structure and styling of the web pages.
    - **JavaScript (D3.js)**: D3.js is used to create the interactive dendrogram visualization that dynamically presents the career paths.
  
- **Authentication**:
    - **Django Allauth**: For advanced authentication features such as login, registration, and password management.

- **Data Visualization**:
    - **D3.js**: A powerful JavaScript library to create dynamic, interactive data visualizations, used here for the dendrogram.
